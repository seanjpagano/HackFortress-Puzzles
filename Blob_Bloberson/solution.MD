Participants are given a binary blob. Use a binary analysis tool like bindiff or hexdump to look at the bin file. Use dd to extract zip directories within the binary. Bindiff will have issues pulling out the data (this is by challenge design). One the zip directories are pulled out and files are extracted, use md5sum on all of the files. You will see that only one file is different than all of the others. Use a hexedititor to look at thebytes of this particular file. Do some research on file headers. Change the header to the correct JPEG header, save the file, and then view the file. The JPEG is a picture of the flag.
